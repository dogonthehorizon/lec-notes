If W is a subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$, any set of vectors X for the span X = W is called a spanning set of W.
 
If in addition X is linearly independent, X is called a bse for W
 
Def$^n$: The dimension of W is the number of vectors in a basis for W 
  -- dim(W) = $|$x$|$ 
  -- lemma Dim(W) is well defined, any subspace with a finite    \ \ spanning set will have the same number of vectors in an basis
 
Proof: Suppose $X$ and $Y$ are bases for W with $\ell$ and $m$ vectors respectively; Without loss of generality suppose $\ell$ $<$ $m$

\[X = \{ \vec{b_1} , \vec{b_2}, ... \vec{b_\ell} \}\]
\[Y = \{ \vec{c_1} , \vec{c_2}, ... \vec{c_m} \}\]
\[\underbrace{\left( \vec{b_1} | \vec{b_2}| ... | \vec{b_\ell} \right)}_A \left( \vec{x_1} | \vec{x_2}| ... | \vec{x_m} \right) = \left( \vec{c_1} | \vec{c_2}| ... | \vec{c_m} \right)\]

Given an $m$ x $n$ matrix A
\[ \vec{T}(x) = A\vec{x}\]
is a linear transformation \[\vec{T}:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^m \]

The column space of A is the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^m$ spanned by the collumns of A
 
The rank of A is dim(col.sp.(A))
 
The null space of A is the subspace of $\mathbb{R}^n$ which is the solution set to $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$ "nullspace(A)"
 
The nullify of A is the null(A) = dim(nullspace(A))
 
\textbf{Rank Thm$^m$:} If a is $m \times n$ then rank(A) + null(A) = n
 
\subsection{Determinants}
 
Given a 2x2 matrix ( a, b | c, d)
 
det( a, b | c, d) = || a, b | c, d || = ad - bc
 
(a,b | c,d) is invertible exactly when ad-bc = 0
